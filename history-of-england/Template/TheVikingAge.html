                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viking Age was a period of time from 800 - 1050 CE in which the English people lived in constant fear of the Scandinavian pirates that raided their cities and preyed on their ships. They were portrayed as bloodthirsty and barbaric. Many, if not most, thought that they were uncivilized and to be hated and feared. Their Viking raids started in 794 when they attacked the mother-house of Iona. Later in 795 the Vikings again attacked Iona from bases on the northern coast of Ireland, burned down the Abbey on Lindisfarne, and murdered and sometimes drowned the monks living there.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbeys and other Christian institutions were often found on small islands so that the monks living there could live in secluded peace. This made them easy objectives&nbsp;as they were isolated and far from the support and safety that the mainland provided, and they were often targeted by the Norsemen. These attacks were not specifically anti-Christian, though the Vikings were not Christian and they had almost no respect for religion and religious spaces, the monasteries were just thought of as easy prey. When the Vikings invaded the Abbey, they were astonished to find that such wealth was left in a place devoid of arms and relatively unguarded.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it was the destruction of the Abbey on Lindisfarne that started the historical “Viking Age,” it was not truly the first occurrence of Norse assaults. The first recorded Viking raid was in the southern Isle of Portland in Wessex when three ships from modern-day Norway landed and were approached by the royal reeve from Dorchester whose job it was to identify all foreign merchants coming into England. The Scandinavians proceed to kill the official. The next year the Vikings sacked the nearby Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the beginning of the ninth century, the Viking parties began raiding and attacking English cities and ports more and more often. They continued this onslaught of more minor incursions until in 835 when the Norsemen launched their first major raid on southern England in the Isle of Sheppey.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of these assaults turned from sporadic to often in the 840s, and by the 850s, the Vikings were establishing settlements in England and spending the winter. In 862 AD, Vikings started to pay more attention to England rather than Frankia because King Charles had inherited West Frankia from Carloman II and he protected it fiercely. If the Vikings were going to continue attacking Frankia, especially West Frankia, they would eventually be defeated. In 865, the Vikings, wanting more supplies, forced the East Angles to support and help them raise an army. It became clear that the Scandinavians were set on conquest. This new army captured York in 866, and a year later gained control of the southern part of the kingdom of Northumbria. Later, Ragnar Hairy-Breeks&nbsp;and his son Ívarr the Boneless became the two main Viking leaders and were responsible for the murders of the King of Northumberland and the King of East Angles, as well as the destruction of the&nbsp;fortress of the British kings of Strathclyde. Ivarr died in Ireland in 873 and was regarded as the king of Northmen in the whole of Ireland and Britain.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Viking ruler led an army to capture Mercia in 874. Later he moved south, and by 878 had forced most of the people of Wessex to submit. After the submission of his kingdom, Wessex’s&nbsp;King Alfred the Great hid in the marshes near Somerset. Later that year, he emerged from hiding, gathered an army, and defeated the Vikings at Wilshire.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfred was very prominent in the field of literature and education. He promoted literacy and may have even translated various works from Latin into English but at the very least provided funds those who did.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the suppression that Alfred forced on the Vikings, the Norsemen moved their army across the channel. This move gave Alfred the time he needed to prepare a navy, build fortresses, and set up a defensive strategy, and organize and improve his army. The next time the Vikings attacked, the West Saxons held.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the ninth century AD, the Vikings had inhabited and settled in Britain. Historians seem to think that when these Scandinavian people had left their country it had been due to overpopulation as well as for riches. They would travel in the beginning by water on large ships, then, as they advanced, they would travel by horses and by boats. The Vikings earned a nickname, “seafaring warriors,” and that they were. Their tactic was a hit and run approach, mainly practiced upon merchant ships carrying valuables to England and the surrounding area.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though many people may have thought the Vikings dangerous, some people like Emperor Lothar actually asked for their help. In 840 Emperor Lothar requested the help of the Vikings to help him in his power struggle with his brothers, and before long, the Vikings had learned that Frankish rulers were willing to pay them a fair amount to stop attacking their subjects. During the conflict between the siblings, Frankia was divided into three kingdoms, East Frankia, West Frankia, and Middle Frankia. With all the chaos in Frankia, it started to become an irresistible target for further Viking activity.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people may think that the Vikings were one to win all of their battles, however, this is most certainly not true. Historians have seen signs of mass Viking graves suggesting that they would fail in some of their attempted raids, especially on foreign kingdoms and territories. However, the Vikings clearly won the majority of the invasions that they made a move on. A few of the reasons that they were so good at raiding was their element of surprise. They were able to appear out of nowhere due to their specially shaped boats. The Vikings also knew when there was going to be a large gathering of people to celebrate or trade. Naturally, they struck on those days when the defense was at its lowest point. In the Early Middle Ages, there were political unrests and internal conflicts which meant that Kings and Princes were fighting between themselves for power. The military wasn’t as strong as it could be at this time, so this was a very popular time for Viking raids. The Vikings were armed with the very best swords, axes, etc, all made by the Frankish swordsmiths.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason that Vikings were exceptional at raiding was because they were very organized. As Roesdahl, a Dutch archaeologist says, “the image of Vikings jumping off boats and charging straight into the nearest town with axes and swords swinging is more of a popular fantasy.”&nbsp;We can suspect that their Viking raids were carefully planned out and executed with precision.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Vikings were very proficient at raiding. They lived in very violent times, a male warrior was required to of completed weapon training so that they were capable of protecting their village if there was an attack. Most importantly of all, they were not scared of dying. As Roesdahl, a Dutch archaeologist says, “according to a saga about the Norwegian king, Magnus Barefoot, who died young during a raid in Ireland, he said: ‘Kings are for honor, not a long life,’ which is a pretty good illustration of the mentality of Viking warriors. It was distinguished and honorable to die valiantly on the battlefield – and honor was more important than anything.”</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of Alfred the Great in October of 899, his son Edward the Elder, and later, his grandson Æthelstan. Edward lead several expeditions while he was in power. During these campaigns with the help of his sister Æthelflæd who was also the widow of the Mercian King, added Mercia&nbsp;to his own kingdom. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles tell us of the submission of the kingdoms of England and their choice to make him their father and lord, though their decision was largely due to their need of protection from the Vikings of Dublin. Æthelstan received a similar submission during his reign in 927 AD. His submissors were mainly Welsh Kings, specifically, Hywel Dda who was apparently a close ally. Æthelstan’s greatest success came in 937 AD when a Viking army led by Olaf Guthfrithson, allied with the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde and invaded Northumbria. Much of Olaf’s nobility and earls died on the battlefield, as well as five other kings.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This victory caused an Irish monk to refer to Æthelstan as “the pillar of the dignity of the western world”. Æthelstan’s reputation was incredible all around the continent, but even after the unlikely success in battle, the threat of the Vikings and scots didn’t lessen. The last Viking King of York was only expelled in 945 AD, after the end of Æthelstan’s rule. Also in 945, the Scots showed their true threat and power and took Edinburgh from England.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 955 AD, there was a period of time (approximately 100 years) where peace descended upon Britain. As the king of Britain at this time, King Edgar,&nbsp;(959 - 975 AD) was creating new laws for “all the nations.” As the Anglo&nbsp;-&nbsp;Saxon Chronicles tells&nbsp;us about King Edgar, “without battle he brought under his sway all that he wished.” King Edgar also took advantage of the power of being king and advanced the reorganization of the church. This is known by most people as the “10th century Reformation.”</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Edgar’s death, his successor reigned briefly before he was murdered. Edgar’s half brother Æthelred II&nbsp;would later take the throne and begin his lengthy reign from 978 to 1016 AD.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the reign of Æthelred II, the new country of Denmark emerged. Denmark grew in power, and soon became a major power in Europe. Denmark had recently converted to Christianity and been united under a single leader. Denmark had seen the wealth of England and began major raids upon it. This was the start of the Second Viking Age.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raids of the Second Viking Age were very different from before. As opposed to the previous many smaller raids, the Vikings of Denmark launched large scale raids led by royals with the intent of extortion. They would invade England, and demand an enormous sum of money to get them to leave. England had no choice to pay these outrageous amounts and developed an extremely intricate taxation system to pay the Danes to leave. These payments were known as “Danegeld.”</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extortion ended in 1013 when Swien&nbsp;Forkbeard, Harald’s son, decided to conquer England. He ordered Æthelred into exile, though, the conclusive conquest of England was only executed by Swien&nbsp;Forkbeard’s&nbsp;son, Cnut.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1016, Cnut became the King of England, and later, Scandinavia. Cnut was a “strong and effective king.” He incorporated a few Danish customs into the English way of life. Cnut became a good leader for the people of his kingdom. In an attempt to reconcile with the English people, Cnut married into the previous English royal family and was quickly bore a son named Harthacnut. However, his current wife had already born a son to her previous husband, Æthelred, He was Edward II. (1042 - 1066)&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Edward died without children, Duke William laid claim to the throne, but so did Harold son of Godwin, a powerful noble. After several confrontations and the near victory of Harold, William prevailed. He was named king, and the last English Royal Dynasty ended.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 250 years of the Vikings oppressing England, they finally gave up and left England alone. Kingdom's by that time had gotten used to the Viking way of raiding and had adapted their military to defend them. The Vikings usually gained what they wanted due to mobility. By working there&nbsp;way around cities the Vikings easily reached their destinations. The kingdoms solved this problem by building giant&nbsp;bridges over the rivers armed with warriors. They would then shoot arrows and throw rocks onto the Vikings below. Using this strategy, the kingdoms in England used up the Viking’s resources until they just gave up.</p>
